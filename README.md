We performed additional experiments to observe the proportional distribution of wandering and focused items in a session in the dataset. The horizontal axis represents the proportion of wandering items in the session, and the ordinate axis represents the number of sessions at this proportion. The Figures are available at  We can see from Fig 1 and Fig 2 that both in the training set and test set of the Amazon-KDD dataset, the proportion of wandering items in a large part of the session is around 10%. In Beauty, the proportion of wandering items in a large part of the session reaches 50% (Fig 3 and Fig 4).
